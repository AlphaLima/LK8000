[Welcome]
Welcome to the LK8000 NotePad file
LK8000\_Configuration\NOTEDEMO.TXT 

PLEASE COPY AND RENAME THIS FILE TO NOTEPAD.TXT and then you can change the content. Every update-upgrade of LK8000 will overwrite NOTEDEMO.TXT!
LK8000 WILL LOAD NOTEPAD.TXT if existing, otherwise the NOTEDEMO.TXT will be selected.

This file must be encoded in UTF8 format. For example, using Windows' Notepad be sure that "Save as" will use UTF8 and not other encodings.
If you choose an incorrect encoding, international characters would not appear, or the whole file may not appear at all.
UTF8 encoding can be made with or without BOM header, it does not matter to LK. 

You can add many pages to this file, each one with a different title.
Each title is enclosed in squared brackets at the beginning of a new line.
Lines starting with # are comments. 
# For example this line will not appear in the notepad.

Try moving to the next page for another example.
